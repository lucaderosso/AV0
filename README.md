# VERY VERY VERY WORK IN PROGRESS

## AV0 - No Intelligence (Only laws)
A max for live patch for my audio visual performance.


#### Questions:
How can a projection play the part of a partner isntead of being the cause of the peroformer actions?
How can the usual 2D projection renew itsef and adapt to different venues?

### Laws:

1. Each layer has a different object type

    `Each layer should be populated with a different object type`

2. Number of obects follows a geometric series
⋅⋅⋅The quantity of characters is defined by the series where each term after the first is twice the previous term e.g.: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16...
3. The window has a scale defined
⋅⋅⋅The window is divided in a checked grid which resolution is designated using the series in law 2.
4. Objecst move according to the scale
⋅⋅⋅Objects move with increments defined dividing the window's size by the designated resolution.
5. Obejcs are arranged on a grid system 
⋅⋅⋅Objects are arranged in space based on a generative grid system in which the number rows and colums is defined using the series in law 2.
6. Obejcs move withing the bounds defined by the grid called roaming areas
⋅⋅⋅An object placed in the top left cell of a 2 by 2 grid will move solely inside that and never invade other spaces in that layer.
7. The size of each object is a fraction of the checked grid increment
⋅⋅⋅Eg: increment = 0.25, size = 0.5, then size = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125. Multiples are 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32
