### AV0 - No Intelligence (Only laws)
A max for live patch for my audio visual performance.


Questions:
How can a projection play the part of a partner isntead of being the cause of the peroformer actions?
How can the usual 2D projection renew itsef and adapt to different venues?

Laws:

1 - Each layer has a different object type.
	Each layer should be populated with a different object type
2 - Number of obects follows a geometric series.
	The quantity of characters is defined by the series where each term after the first is twice the previous term e.g.: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16...
3 - The window has a scale defined.
	The window is divided in a checked grid which resolution is designated using the series in law 2.
4 - Objecst move according to the scale.
	Objects move with increments defined dividing the window's size by the designated resolution.
5 - Obejcs are arranged on a grid system. 
	Objects are arranged in space based on a generative grid system in which the number rows and colums is defined using the series in law 2.
6 - Obejcs move withing the bounds defined by the grid called roaming areas.
	An object placed in the top left cell of a 2 by 2 grid will move solely inside that and never invade other spaces in that layer.
7 - The size of each object is a fraction of the checked grid increment
	Eg: increment = 0.25, size = 0.5, then size = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125. Multiples are 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32
